# Volatile Laboratories Memory Puzzle
#### Joe Murphy


 
## How does it work?
* A sequence of 5 coloured bulkhead lights will flash in the hallway of Volatile Laboratories. These will be controlled by Qlab and the sequence (order) will not change.

* The user will look at the sequence of flashing lights and try to remember them. Or another member of their team will 

* The users task is to repeat the correct sequence of flashing lights back by pressing the 5 coloured buttons mounted on the wall in the smaller room. It would beep loud on correct and give a 4 digit code for the switches 

The lights will be controlled by Qlab and the order will not change. 


For example these coloured lights will flash in this order: Yellow, Red, White, Blue, Green.

The user must then push the coloured buttons in this order: Yellow, Red, White, Blue, Green.

The buttons are essentially a 5 digit passcode.

Colours of lights/buttons:
-White
-Red
-Blue
-Green
-Yellow
